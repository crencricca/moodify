Moodify:
Custom Spotify playlist recommendations based on your mood.

Moodify takes the user through a brief quiz where they select a mood, activity and genre of music. The app uses their custom input and links them to a Spotify playlist that best matches their input. Once the user has completed the quiz, they can either open the Spotify playlist in a browser window or restart the quiz. The app also implements user authentication by automatically opening a Spotify login window when the app is opened by a new user for the first time.
